# UnityUIExamples
Unity UI Example projects from our September workshop

There are two projects here, one which I prepared before the class, and one that we built during class, which differs in some features and some design decisions. Feel free to take a look at both! 

You can add them to your unity Hub by clicking on the **Add** button and then selecting one of these folders. 

## SolarUI

This was my preparation project, which contains the features that we planned to cover. It differs a little from what we ended up doing:

- It includes an example of using `Ray` to check for clicking on objects, which as we discussed can be quite useful if you want the logic for checking what is being clicked on to be separate from the individual objects which can be clicked on!
- It has particle effects (planets explode when you click on them)
    - Includes logic to destroy the special effects object once the explosion is over and destroy the planet object.
- Reset button for timer / one of the planets. 


## My Solar System

This was the project we developed together. It is similar but has some different features as we were free-forming!

- Click on planets to create moons
- Button reverses gravity from the star
